<!-- generated:curated-entry -->

Use the Open Design skill `od:prototype:social-x-post-card` (X / Twitter Post Card).

Brief: "$ARGUMENTS", or if empty: "Use the X / Twitter Post Card template to turn my content into a realistic X post card with engagement metrics for a video overlay or shareable image card. Preserve the template's visual signature, use real content and data, and avoid lorem ipsum or placeholder images."

Call `prepare_open_design_brief` (the open-design MCP server's tool) with skillId "od:prototype:social-x-post-card" and this brief — call `list_open_design_design_systems` first only if the user names a brand or visual direction. Author the files yourself with your own file-editing tools per the returned instructions, then call `register_open_design_artifact`.
