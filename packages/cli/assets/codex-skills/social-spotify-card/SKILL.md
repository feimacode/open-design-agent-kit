description: Spotify Now-Playing Card (Open Design) — use only when explicitly invoked, not for general design requests

<!-- generated:open-design-agent-kit -->

Use the Open Design skill `od:prototype:social-spotify-card` (Spotify Now-Playing Card).

Treat the rest of the user's message as the brief. If nothing more specific was given, use: "Use the Spotify Now-Playing Card template to turn my content into a Spotify Now Playing-style card with album art, progress bar, and playback controls for a video overlay or personal homepage. Preserve the template's visual signature, use real content and data, and avoid lorem ipsum or placeholder images."

Call `prepare_open_design_brief` (the open-design MCP server's tool) with skillId "od:prototype:social-spotify-card" and this brief — call `list_open_design_design_systems` first only if the user names a brand or visual direction. Author the files yourself with your own file-editing tools per the returned instructions, then call `register_open_design_artifact`.
