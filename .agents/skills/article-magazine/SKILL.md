<!-- generated:open-design-agent-kit -->

Use the Open Design skill `od:prototype:article-magazine` (Magazine Article).

Treat the rest of the user's message as the brief. If nothing more specific was given, use: "Use the Magazine Article template to turn my content into a Huashu / huashu-md-html-inspired long-form HTML essay. Preserve the template's visual signature, use real content and data, and avoid lorem ipsum or placeholder images."

Call `prepare_open_design_brief` (the open-design MCP server's tool) with skillId "od:prototype:article-magazine" and this brief — call `list_open_design_design_systems` first only if the user names a brand or visual direction. Author the files yourself with your own file-editing tools per the returned instructions, then call `register_open_design_artifact`.
