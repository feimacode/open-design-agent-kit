description: Guizang Editorial E-Ink Deck (OpenDesign) — use only when explicitly invoked, not for general design requests
---

<!-- generated:open-design-agent-kit -->

Use the OpenDesign skill `od:deck:deck-guizang-editorial` (Guizang Editorial E-Ink Deck).

Treat the rest of the user's message as the brief. If nothing more specific was given, use: "Use the Guizang Editorial E-Ink Deck template to turn my content into an editorial magazine x e-ink horizontal deck with 10 layouts and 5 palettes. Preserve the template's visual signature, use real content and data, and avoid lorem ipsum or placeholder images."

Call `prepare_open_design_brief` (the open-design MCP server's tool) with skillId "od:deck:deck-guizang-editorial" and this brief — call `list_open_design_design_systems` first only if the user names a brand or visual direction. Author the files yourself with your own file-editing tools per the returned instructions, then call `register_open_design_artifact`.
