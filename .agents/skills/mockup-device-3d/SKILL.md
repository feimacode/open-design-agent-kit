<!-- generated:open-design-agent-kit -->

Use the Open Design skill `od:prototype:mockup-device-3d` (Device 3D Showcase).

Treat the rest of the user's message as the brief. If nothing more specific was given, use: "Use the Device 3D Showcase template to turn my content into a static iPhone and MacBook 3D-style showcase with real HTML embedded on the screens. Preserve the template's visual signature, use real content and data, and avoid lorem ipsum or placeholder images."

Call `prepare_open_design_brief` (the open-design MCP server's tool) with skillId "od:prototype:mockup-device-3d" and this brief — call `list_open_design_design_systems` first only if the user names a brand or visual direction. Author the files yourself with your own file-editing tools per the returned instructions, then call `register_open_design_artifact`.
